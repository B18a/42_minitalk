  Project - minitalk
</h1>

The Minitalk project involves creating a simple data exchange program using UNIX signals. Participants will develop a client-server model where the server receives and prints messages sent by the client via SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. The server should efficiently handle multiple messages without restarting, and error management is crucial. A bonus task includes adding acknowledgment signals and supporting Unicode characters. Successful completion will demonstrate understanding of signal handling in C and allow for integration into future projects.
